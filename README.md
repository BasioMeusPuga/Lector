        $ python3 setup.py build
        # python3 setup.py install
3. OR launch with `lector/__main__.py`

## Translations
1. There is a `SAMPLE.ts` file [here](https://github.com/BasioMeusPuga/Lector/tree/master/lector/resources/translations). Open it in `Qt Linguist`.
2. Pick the language you wish to translate to.
3. Translate relevant strings.
4. Try to resist the urge to include profanity.
5. Save the file as `Lector_<language>` and send it to me, preferably as a pull request.

Please keep the translations short. There's only so much space for UI elements.
